Someone has joined you on <%= @glip.title %>!

You now have <%= @glip.participants.size %> people participating and you gained 2 reputations points (which unlock new
privileges as you go). Soon you will be able to invite people to take part in your Glip, challenges,
and more!

You should encourage them by leaving them a comment on their Glip. From
their profile you can follow them, see their other Glips (maybe you can join one of theirs), and more!

See your Glip here: <%= glip_url(@glip) %>
