<h1>You have a new participant!</h1>
<p>
<%= @participation.user.username %> has joined you on "<%= @glip.title %>"!
<br />
You now have <%= @glip.participants.size %> and you gained 2 reputations points (which unlock new
privileges as you go). Soon you will be able to invite people to take part in your Glip, challenges,
and more!
<br />
You should encourage <%= @participation.user.username %> by leaving them a comment on their Glip. From
their profile you can follow them, see their other Glips (maybe you can join one of theirs), and more!
<%= user_url(@participation.user) %></p>
