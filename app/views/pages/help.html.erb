      Welcome to the Glipboard Help Center. Use this page to get better acquainted with the features and inner workings of the site.<br/>
      <a id="Overview"></a><h3 style: "float: left; display: inline-block;">Overview</h3>
        Glipboard is a goal-sharing social network. The idea is to provide as many tools as possible to help you accompish your goals, which we call glips. 
        (We think of a goal as a series of tiny obstacles you have to overcome to achieve it. These obstacles are like little <em>glips</em> on the road to success.)
        Post glips and track your progress by submitting periodic <a href="#Logs">logs</a> about what you're doing to bring yourself closer to your goal. You 
        can then search the site for resources  like <a href="#Articles">articles</a> and <a href="#Groups">groups</a> that might bring you closer to success. 
        Not only that, you can use your own knowledge and expertise to help others on their own goals. Use this help page to better understand what all of our
        features are and how you can utilize them to have the best chance of success.

      <a id="Glips"></a><h3>Glips</h3>
        Glips are the star of the show here at Glipboard, and they're important because you can't finish what you don't start. Glips are a foot in the right direction.
        They are a way of holding yourself accountable, of declaring your intentions to yourself and the world. You are more likely to be successful if you write down your
        goals.<a href="https://sidsavara-sidsavaracom.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/researchsummary2.pdf"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 12px;"><sup>[1]</sup></span></a><br />
        
        <h5>Posting Glips</h5>
        Posting a new glip is easy. Every glip you see on the site has a button at the top of the right sidebar. There is also a link in the navigation
        bar if you click your username. You can also just <%= link_to "click right here", new_glip_path %>. <br />
        
        <h5>Better Glips</h5>
        We want you to succeed, which is why we want to help you set the best goals possible. Here are some things to think about, which will help you compose stronger glips:
        <ul>
          <li>What would you like to accomplish? Be specific.
            <ul>
              <li><em><b>Get better at running</b></em> isn't a well-crafted glip, because it's too vague and it's too subjective.</li>
              <li><em><b>Run 3 miles a week</b></em> is better, it's more specific. It leaves off the "get better" part and focuses on concrete, objective things.
              It doesn't, however, specify a stopping point. For how long will this go on?</li>
              <li><em><b>Run 3 miles a week until I can do it all at once</b></em> is more like it, as before the running could be broken up into chunks. The glip
              also now has an obvious end point.</li>
              <li><em><b>Run 3 miles a week until I can do it all at once in under 24 minutes</b></em> is the most specific, and coming up with milestones for this
              wouldn't be hard.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>How long will it take you to get there? 
            <ul>
              <li>If your goal will take longer than 6 months, you should consider breaking it up into smaller goals.</li>
              <li>If your goal can be completed all at once, it is more like a task. Is there something more long-term you can place this task inside of?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>How will you know you are finished?
            <ul>
              <li>Your goal should be measureable. This way you know when you hit your goal and any milestones.</li>
              <li><em>Learn Spanish</em> isn't a good Glip by itself because it is too vague. How will you know you've accomplished this? It's okay to want to 
              learn a new language, great in fact. But you should break it up or add smaller goals along the way.</li>
              <li>Set a completion criteria so you know exactly when you're finished. <em>Complete Rosetta Stone Levels 1-3</em> might be a good completion
              criteria, or <em>Have a fluid conversation with a native speaker for 1 hour.</em> Just be specific.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      <br /><div class="small"><a href="#Top">Back to Top</a></div>
      
      <a id="Criteria"></a><h4>Completion Criteria</h4>
        Completion criteria is how you'll know you've completed your glip. It's the finish line. A good completion criteria usually starts with <em>When I do x...</em> or <em>When x happens...</em>.
